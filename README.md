This is a repository for all the code I am writing for my dissertation.
The bulk of the project involves calculating correlation functions via pair counting.
Error estimates are also calculated using the jackknife error estimation method.
The project is still in its earlier stages and will be updated weekly. 

main.py - main program inside which all tests are run

modules.py - contains all the modules

plotting.py - contains some plotting modules to make data visualization easier

estimator_stability.py - tests the stability of the various correlation funciton estimators

jackknife.py - tests the jackknife error estimating method
